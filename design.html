      <p>
        As Design Editor for the University of Washington's newspaper <em>The Daily</em>,
        I layout and design each page for our weekly production using the Adobe Suite programs.
        I also handle the hiring and directing of our designers that help layout the issue.
        I have compiled here several clippings from our various issues including our regular
        weekly produciton, Game Daily, and Pacific Wave magazine.
        All Design work below is done by myself
